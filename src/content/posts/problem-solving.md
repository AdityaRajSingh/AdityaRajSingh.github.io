# The Art of Problem-Solving in Tech

3:17 AM. My phone buzzes.

"Production is down. Users can't log in. Revenue dropping fast."

I'm wide awake instantly. Heart racing. Mind blank.

This was my first major production incident. I panicked, made random changes, and made everything worse.

That night taught me: **panic is the enemy of problem-solving.**

## The SOLVE Framework

After that disaster, I developed a systematic approach:

- **S**top and assess
- **O**utline the problem
- **L**ist possible solutions
- **V**erify with data
- **E**xecute and monitor

## S - Stop and Assess

**First rule: Don't panic.**

Take 60 seconds to breathe and assess:
- How bad is this really?
- Who's affected?
- Is it getting worse?
- Do I have time to think?

That 60 seconds can save hours of thrashing.

**Triage everything:**
- **Critical:** Production down
- **High:** Performance degraded
- **Medium:** Non-critical features broken
- **Low:** Minor bugs

## O - Outline the Problem

**Vague problems lead to vague solutions.**

Instead of "the app is slow," be specific:

"The search API returns results in 4+ seconds for queries with 3+ words, affecting 60% of traffic during peak hours, causing 25% drop in engagement."

**Use the 5Ws:**
- **What** exactly is broken?
- **Who** is experiencing this?
- **When** does it happen?
- **Where** in the system?
- **Why** does it matter?

## L - List Possible Solutions

**Never fall in love with your first idea.**

Generate options using the 3-Horizon approach:

**Quick Fixes (Hours):** Restart services, increase capacity, add caching
**Medium-term (Weeks):** Code optimizations, database improvements
**Long-term (Months):** System redesign, technology migration

**Rate each solution (1-5):**
- Speed of implementation
- Impact on the problem
- Risk level
- Resource cost

## V - Verify with Data

**Measure twice, cut once.**

Before implementing:
1. Establish baseline metrics
2. Define success criteria
3. Set up monitoring
4. Plan rollback procedures

**Test small:** Route 5% traffic → measure → scale gradually

## E - Execute and Monitor

**Implementation is just the beginning.**

**Gradual rollout:** Staging → 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%

**Post-fix review:**
- Did it solve the problem?
- Any unexpected side effects?
- What would we do differently?
- How do we prevent recurrence?

## Real-World Examples

### The Database Crisis
**Problem:** API response times spiking to 10+ seconds
**Quick Fix:** Redis caching (down to 2 seconds)
**Long-term:** Database sharding (consistent 100ms)
**Lesson:** Layer solutions. Quick fixes buy time for proper fixes.

### The Memory Leak
**Problem:** Servers crashing every 6 hours
**Root Cause:** Event listeners not cleaned up
**Solution:** Proper cleanup in component unmount
**Lesson:** Tools beat guessing. Use profilers.

## Power Techniques

### Rubber Duck Debugging 2.0
1. Explain the problem in simple terms
2. Walk through what you've tried
3. Explain your theory
4. Solution often becomes obvious

### Enhanced 5 Whys
Don't just ask "why"—also ask "what if" and "how might we"

### Constraint Removal
When stuck, temporarily ignore constraints:
- What if budget wasn't an issue?
- What if we could rewrite everything?

Then add constraints back, keeping the best ideas.

## Building Your Skills

**Practice regularly:**
- Debug open-source issues
- Solve coding challenges systematically
- Help teammates with problems

**Learn from others:**
- Read company post-mortems
- Join SRE communities
- Study how experts approach problems

**Build your toolkit:**
- Monitoring (know what's happening)
- Logging (understand what went wrong)
- Profiling (find bottlenecks)
- Testing (verify solutions)

## The Right Mindset

**Curiosity over Certainty** → Ask questions, don't assume
**Collaboration over Hero Complex** → Involve others
**Learning over Blame** → Focus on prevention
**Systems Thinking** → Address root causes

## Your Checklist

□ Take a breath and assess
□ Define the problem specifically
□ Generate multiple solutions
□ Evaluate options objectively
□ Start with lowest-risk solution
□ Monitor results closely
□ Document learnings
□ Share knowledge

## The Bottom Line

Problem-solving isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about being systematic, curious, and persistent.

Every expert was once a beginner. Every elegant solution started messy.

The goal isn't perfection—it's continuous improvement.

One problem at a time.
